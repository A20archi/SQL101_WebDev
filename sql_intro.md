SQL stands for Structured Query Language-its similar to the English language and it is used to put queries into the Database

SQL can be used mainly by web developers, database admins, and for data analysts

SQL terminologies -

1. Datum - Similar to Data -> Datum is a single entity and we store the entire necessary information 

2.Collection of Data is the Database --> need to be organized and Structured ( schema for that -> structure of Database)

Tables -> rows and columns of data --> record simply means a single row 

Relational Database Management System --> RDBMS--> RDBMS stands for **Relational Database Management System**. It‚Äôs the type of database system most commonly used in web development, including for SQL. Let me break it down clearly:

---

1Ô∏è‚É£ What it is**

An **RDBMS** is software that lets you **store, manage, and retrieve data** in a structured way using **tables** (rows and columns).

---

2Ô∏è‚É£ Key Components**

* **Tables:** Store data in rows (records) and columns (fields).
* **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each row (like `id`).
* **Foreign Key:** A column that links one table to another.
* **SQL:** The language used to interact with RDBMS (insert, update, query, delete).

---

3Ô∏è‚É£ Examples**

* **PostgreSQL**
* **MySQL / MariaDB**
* **SQLite**
* **Oracle Database**
* **Microsoft SQL Server**

---

4Ô∏è‚É£ Why it‚Äôs important for webdev**

* Stores user data, posts, products, orders, etc.
* Supports **relationships** between data (e.g., users ‚Üî posts).
* Works well with **backends** like Node.js/Express, Next.js, Django, etc.

---

 5Ô∏è‚É£ Quick visual analogy

Think of an RDBMS as **an Excel spreadsheet on steroids**:

* Each **table** = a sheet
* Each **row** = a record
* Each **column** = a property of that record
* SQL lets you **query, filter, and manipulate** the data easily

**Relational Databases - In Detail**
Relational databases are a type of database that organizes data into tables, which consist of rows and columns. Each table represents a specific entity or concept, and the relationships between these tables are established through keys.

**Key Concepts of Relational Databases:**

1. **Tables**: Data is stored in tables, where each table has a unique name and consists of rows (records) and columns (fields). Each column represents a specific attribute of the entity, while each row represents a single instance of that entity.

2. **Primary Key**: A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each row can be uniquely identified and helps maintain data integrity.

3. **Foreign Key**: A foreign key is a column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between the two tables, allowing for data to be linked and queried across them.

4. **Relationships**: Relationships between tables can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. These relationships are defined using primary and foreign keys.

5. **Normalization**: Normalization is the process of organizing data in a relational database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them.

## üìä SQL vs NoSQL

| Feature            | SQL (Relational DB) üóÑÔ∏è                   | NoSQL (Non-relational DB) üìÇ                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Model**     | Tables (rows & columns)                  | Documents, Key-Value, Graph, Column-based                 |
| **Schema**         | Fixed, predefined schema                 | Flexible / schema-less                                    |
| **Relationships**  | Strong (joins, foreign keys)             | Weak / handled at app level                               |
| **Consistency**    | ACID (Strong consistency)                | BASE (Eventual consistency, mostly)                       |
| **Scalability**    | Vertical (scale up: bigger server)       | Horizontal (scale out: sharding across many servers)      |
| **Best For**       | Structured data, transactions, analytics | Unstructured / semi-structured data, fast changing schema |
| **Query Language** | SQL (powerful, standardized)             | Database-specific APIs (e.g. MongoDB queries in JSON)     |
| **Use Cases**      | Banking, ERP, E-commerce, HR systems     | Social media, IoT, real-time chat, content storage        |

üëâ **Rule of thumb:**

* If you need **relationships & consistency ‚Üí SQL**.
* If you need **flexibility & scalability ‚Üí NoSQL**.
