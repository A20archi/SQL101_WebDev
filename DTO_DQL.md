Data Transfer Objects

DTOs in SQL refer to objects or structures used to transfer data between different layers or components of an application,typically between the database and the application layer.DTOs are designed to be simple containers for carrying data. Though DTO is a concept applied at the application level, it is closely related to how data is structured and queried in SQL databases.

**Data Query Language (DQL)**

DQL is a subset of SQL used for querying and retrieving data from a database. The primary DQL command is `SELECT`, which allows users to specify the data they want to retrieve from one or more tables.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```
